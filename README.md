# Is-EgyptFWD-ITIDA-Udacity-initiative-a-life-saver-
I graduated from veterinary medicine 20 years ago, a happy enthusiastic fresh graduate. I was dreaming to build my career in the pharmaceutical marketing business, filled with joy of selling newly launched medication representing big multinational pharmaceutical companies.
Started a part time job in one of my dream multinational companies and started to get promoted then head hunted by another bigger dream company. Very proud of my achievements in marketing and selling any pharmaceutical products, launched more and more products and gained more money until I hit the thirties. Then everything stopped! Vanished!
I got fired from my dream company after this huge success because my salary was bigger than the company new policy of downsizing. Egypt then was suffering from economic crisis and big companies reconsidered their policies to downsizing or shut down.
Suddenly, I’m at home jobless, desperate, older than any available job in the pharmaceutical marketing field.
I have a family, children, debts, loans and I’m jobless!
I calmed myself and started searching for a job, any job, I need to work, I need to gain money. Anything...anyhelp!!
One day, I found an ad on Facebook about the FWD scholarship initiative with ITIDA.
